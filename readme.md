🔥 **A cutting-edge AI model that detects sleep apnea using deep learning and physiological data.**  
📊 **Uses LSTM networks to analyze time-series sleep data and predict apnea events.**  
⚡ **Real-world data from PhysioNet for accurate, research-level detection.**  

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
Sleep apnea is a **serious sleep disorder** where breathing repeatedly stops and starts. Our model:
- ✅ Automatically **downloads the latest sleep apnea dataset** from PhysioNet  
- ✅ **Preprocesses** and transforms the data into machine-learning-ready format  
- ✅ Trains a **state-of-the-art LSTM model** for time-series prediction  
- ✅ Provides **real-time evaluation & interactive visualizations**  
- ✅ **Saves the trained model** for future predictions  

---

## 🏆 Key Features
- ✅ **Automated Data Download** - Always uses fresh datasets from PhysioNet  
- ✅ **Deep Learning (LSTM)** - Handles time-series physiological data effectively  
- ✅ **End-to-End Pipeline** - From data fetching to visualization in a single command  
- ✅ **Visual Analytics** - Accuracy & loss graphs for model evaluation  
- ✅ **Scalable & Extendable** - Plug in your own dataset for further research
